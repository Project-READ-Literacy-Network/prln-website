### Soft Skills Solutions© – Facilitator Training Workshop Refresher

The cost for Refresher training virtually is $100 per person and a minimum of 10 people are required.  

**Cancellation and no-show fees:**  
We have implemented a new cancellation policy.  Moving forward, once registered for a session: If you cancel or change who will be attending five businesses days prior to the session and have already paid, you can re-register for another session at no charge.  If you do not cancel or change who will be attending five businesses days prior to the session you will be charged the full rate.  However, if you re-register for another session date and send an email reminder to sss@smwdb.com you will only be charged 50% of the registration fee.
