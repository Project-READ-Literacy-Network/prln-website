### About Bridges Out of Poverty  

Bridges Out of Poverty is a strength-based approach to working with people living in poverty, either generational or situational.

If your organization works with people living in poverty, only a deeper understanding of their challenges — and strengths — will help you partner with them to create opportunities for success. At this 3-hour workshop, participants will:
- Understand a new definition of poverty and the resources clients need to move beyond the margins
- Develop an understanding of the mental models of class
- Become more aware of research on the causes of poverty
- Understand some hidden rules of poverty vs. middle class
- Begin thinking about how to apply Bridges concepts within their organization
