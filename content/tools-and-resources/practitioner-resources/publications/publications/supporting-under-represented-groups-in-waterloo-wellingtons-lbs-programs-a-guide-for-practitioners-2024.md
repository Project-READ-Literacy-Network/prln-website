The included resources are based on Skills for Success Project Phase 1 research, and Phase 2 community organization outreach and interviews, completed in 2023 by Project READ Literacy Networkâ€™s Skills for Success Project LSP Under-represented Groups Working committee members. They are intended to help our LBS programs best support Indigenous persons, Transient/Homeless persons and persons with Moderate to Significant Anxiety as Under-represented groups in our LBS programs.
