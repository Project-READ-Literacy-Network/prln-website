This is a Numeracy Curriculum for learners at Essential Skills Levels 1 and 2.  Its main focus is to use real life numeracy activities as a starting point in order to develop skills required in the workplace.  The curriculum is set up for a six week class, three days per week, at three hours per day, but was also field-tested as a stand-alone document for each class.  The learning is also supplemented with many on-line sites and the learning is enhanced through using the LearningHub with learners.  The LearningHub is familiar with the curriculum and has set up specific learning to assist with individuals going through the various activities.
