This project brought together the agencies that provide language and literacy programming within the regions of Project READ Literacy Network and Peel Halton Dufferin Adult Learning Network in Ontario. The goal was to enhance communication and referrals among the agencies. All of the agencies and their representatives took a leap of faith and agreed to devote time and energy to examining how each of them provide services to the adults in their communities. This project was the first step in a journey to provide the best and most responsive services to the adults, who have language and literacy challenges in our regions. This Report outlines the facilitative process and tools used to engage the agencies in discussion. It provides the key recommendations and conclusions that resulted from the partnership development. It is a guide that can be used in other jurisdictions.
