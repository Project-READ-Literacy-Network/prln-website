This workshop was developed to help frontline Employment Service practitioners understand how to talk about “literacy” with their clients and how to successfully refer them to LBS programs. It also provides training on how to use the screening tool for literacy needs that was developed for the Labour Market Partnership (LMP) – Phase 2 project in partnership with LLSC.
