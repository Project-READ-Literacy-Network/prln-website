Get Set Learn is a family literacy program that focuses on both parents and their children. GSL is designed to provide a safe, nurturing, learning environment so that families from different backgrounds, with their varying levels of literacy and math skills, are respected and can contribute to the class (prior knowledge). Parents are encouraged to play in literacy and math-rich ways in order to increase their children’s understanding of math and language concepts. This 10-week program recognizes that parents are their child’s first teacher. It has both parent and child together time (PACT) and separate parent and child time. This provides opportunities for parents to learn the strategies and tools to enhance their children’s learning and they are given “guided practice”  with their children in order to experience these strategies.
