This project, upon reflection, was praxis in service coordination and system integration. Enhancing Pathways Phase 2 allowed language, literacy and regional network staff to engage in a collaborative examination of how agencies work together for the benefit of those they serve.  
  
Our collective responsibility to the citizens of Ontario is to conceptualize and provide a highly responsive and effective system for meeting the growing literacy and language needs of our workforce. The participation of local agencies and other stakeholder groups in the development of system integration through funded, formal processes is being recognized throughout the world.  
  
The overall goal of this project was to engage in a knowledge transfer phase to share and build the coordination capacity of regional literacy networks (five pilot sites) and the programs they support to understand the roles each plays in service coordination. Enhancing Pathways Phase 2 built upon the results and outcomes of Phase 1, to further the partnership development among service delivery agencies that provide literacy and language programming. The five Pilot Sites included: Adult Basic Education Association (Hamilton); Literacy Link South Central (London); Literacy Network of Durham Region (Durham); Peel Halton Dufferin Adult Learning Network (Peel Halton); and Project READ Literacy Network (Waterloo and Wellington).
