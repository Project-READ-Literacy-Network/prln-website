The D.E.S.K. Essential Skills Profiles contains 15 profiles that reflect the tasks that individuals living with diabetes have to perform on a regular basis. The profiles have been separated into 3 groups:

- Understanding Profiles (example: Understanding Type 1 Diabetes)
- Managing Profiles (example: Managing and Measuring Blood Glucose Levels)
- Complications Profiles (example: Understanding and Managing Foot Complications)  
  
These profiles are meant to be used by both Health Practitioners and Literacy Practitioners.
