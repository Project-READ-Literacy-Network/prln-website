We are delighted to offer this Essential Skills training program for women aged forty plus who are seeking employment. It has been field-tested in British Columbia and Ontario and it has been proven effective. This manual is written for the facilitator, and it outlines the learning progressions, women-centred activities, and hands-on worksheets for the course participants.  
  
Older women, especially immigrants, experience higher rates of unemployment than the general population. Often they are challenged in their job search by a lack of formal education and low literacy. In response to the economic climate and needs voiced within our own community, we developed a curriculum for older women who are low-skilled and unemployed.  
  
The program is designed to help participants increase their Essential Skills and their confidence so that they can build employability skills. The curriculum consists of two main modules, each consisting of eight units, and a third wrap-up section consisting of one unit. Here’s the breakdown: Module One: Exploring Myself; Module Two: Exploring My Community; and Creating My Action Plan: Exploring My Future.
