PRLN, LiNDR, Tri-County, CSC and COFA researched and developed a guide on the work being done with SSMs in all phases.  This report includes best practices for LBS support and service delivery organizations in the Phase 2 and 3 of EST to potentially implement.  
  
The information and practices within this guide are solely the work and opinions of independent LBS agencies and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the Ministry.
