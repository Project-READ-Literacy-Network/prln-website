This is our project report for our portion of the LMP â€“ Phase 2 project managed by LLSC.  In the appendices you will find the screening tool for Employment Services and OW staff to use to help in referring clients to LBS programs.  There is a guide for adapting the tool to your specific regional needs.  We have also included a copy of the common referral form that is used across EO and OW programs in Waterloo-Wellington.
