The purpose of Building a Performance Framework for LBS Support Organizations in Ontario (CIPMS for LBS Support Organizations) was to provide support organizations with the opportunity to enhance their understanding of the key processes and elements of Continuous Improvement Performance Management (CIPMS)—as it applies to them. Funded by the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities (MTCU), Project READ Literacy Network engaged a project consultant. The work was supported by an advisory team that included staff from a cross-section of LBS support organizations and from MTCU. This final project report contains a performance framework that includes sample outcome statements, performance indicators and measurement tools for the service functions provided by support organizations (networks) in the Literacy and Basic Skills field in Ontario.
