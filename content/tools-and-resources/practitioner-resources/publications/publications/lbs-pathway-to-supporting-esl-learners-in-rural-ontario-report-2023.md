This research report includes the findings & analysis of data from Statistics Canada, plus information solicited from 52 rural LBS agencies who are currently serving ESL learners or have served them in the past, to:
1. map out where in Ontario there is a need for LBS to provide service to language learners;
2. identify challenges & barriers that rural LBS programs have when serving language learners;
3. outline best practices for accommodating language learners in LBS classrooms (program considerations & delivery strategies);
4. list recommended intake and assessment tools, resources, training materials, and learning activities; and,
5. make key recommendations for systemic changes needed in LBS to enable agencies to fill gaps in training to newcomers in rural areas.
