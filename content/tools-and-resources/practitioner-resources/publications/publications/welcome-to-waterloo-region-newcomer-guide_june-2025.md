Created by Project READ Literacy Network Waterloo-Wellington, this guide: Welcome to Waterloo Region! Community Information for Newcomers, centralizes essential information to help individuals with language barriers access the services they need. It is organized into several sections addressing critical areas of need for newcomers:  
- Cultural Orientation
- Language Learning
- Job Searching & Career Resources
- Housing
- Community Engagement
- Other Resources  
  
Learning about and utilizing available resources can be time-consuming and tedious. With personal experience as a newcomer and an understanding of the challenges faced when arriving in the Waterloo Region or Canada, the compiler has gathered key resources in this guide to support both newcomers and those working with them.
