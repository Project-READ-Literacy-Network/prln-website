Founded in 1988, Project READ Literacy Network is a doorway to literacy and Essential Skills services offered in our Waterloo-Wellington. Project READ believes that literacy and Essential Skills are necessary for an individual to reach their full potential and function independently. Low literacy affects many aspects of life including, health, income, employment, parenting, education and daily living; Literacy matters. Through our network and programs, we are dedicated to providing our community with:
- Equal access to information and resources to support family literacy needs and goals
- Opportunities for parents and caring adults to develop the skills and strategies necessary to support their children’s early literacy development and school readiness
- Peer mentoring and training that will help adults build confidence, literacy skills, employability skills and employment income
- Safe and welcoming environments that foster a sense of belonging, community, meaningful connections, and a love of learning
