Reading Rumble is a book trivia fundraising event for teams to have fun & compete for prizes - all while supporting literacy in Waterloo-Wellington! It was a fun and energizing social event for everyone!  Our 2022 book selections were Canadian Award winners "Fight Night" by Miriam Toews & "Dirty Birds" by Murray Morgan. Thank You to all of our participants and donors for making this year's Reading Rumble a successful and exciting event for everyone!
