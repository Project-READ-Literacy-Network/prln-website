Reading Rumble is a book trivia fundraising event for teams to have fun & compete for prizes - all while supporting literacy in Waterloo-Wellington! It was a fun and energizing social event for everyone! Our 2025 acclaimed Canadian book selections were “Never Shoot a Stampede Queen” by Mark Lerien-Young & “A Town Called Solace” by Mary Lawson. Thank You to all of our participants, sponsors and donors for making this year’s Reading Rumble a successful and exciting event for everyone!
