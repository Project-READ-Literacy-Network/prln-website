Reading Rumble is a book trivia fundraising event for teams to have fun & compete for prizes - all while supporting literacy in Waterloo-Wellington! It was a fun and energizing social event for everyone!  Our 2023 book selections are Canadian Award winners "The Spirits Up" by Todd Babiak & "The Divine Ryans" by Wayne Johnson. Thank You to all of our participants and donors for making this year's Reading Rumble a successful and exciting event for everyone!
