Reading Rumble is a book trivia fundraising event for teams to have fun & compete for prizes - all while supporting literacy in Waterloo-Wellington! It was a fun and energizing social event for everyone!  Our 2024 acclaimed Canadian book selections were "Everyone in This Room Will Someday Be Dead" by Emily Austin & "Under an Outlaw Moon" by Dietrich Kalteis. Thank You to all of our participants and donors for making this year's Reading Rumble a successful and exciting event for everyone!
