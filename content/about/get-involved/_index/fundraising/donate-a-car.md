Project READ Literacy Network  is partnered with Donate a Car Canada to accept your vehicle donation! You will be provided free towing, or you can drop off your vehicle to maximize your donation. When you donate your car, truck, RV, boat, or motorcycle to Project READ Literacy Network through Donate A Car Canada, it will either be recycled or re-sold (depending on its condition, age and location). Donate a Car Canada will look after all the details to make it easy for Project READ Literacy Network to benefit. You will receive a tax receipt after your vehicle donation has been processed!
