**Facebook Fundraisers & Donations**  
The mission of Facebooks’s fundraising products is to inspire people to give. Whether it’s through Birthday Fundraisers, Stories, GivingTuesday, or Instagram, they are inspired by how our community comes together to make the world a better place. The fundraising  tools are available for people to raise funds to support causes they care about, like Project READ.  
  
Facebook has partnered exclusively with PayPal Giving Fund, which collects donations and distributes donated funds to nonprofits in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
