We provide Educational Assessments for Adults. An Assessment can help to identify a person's skill levels (reading, writing, spelling, math, etc.) so they can find the right upgrading and training program to reach educational and employment goals. It is often the beginning of a personâ€™s pathway to success: a better job, higher level training, post-secondary education, high school diploma or GED, and independence.
